## 🧑‍💻 **Purpose**  
- Sort student records based on grade  

## 🔧 **Technology**  
- COBOL (cobc)

---

## 📝 **Description**  
The **STUDENT-SORTER** program reads student records from a file, sorts them by grade in ascending order, and writes the sorted records to a new file. This helps to quickly organize student data in a readable format.

---

## 📂 **File Details**  
- **Input File**: `students.txt`  
  - A text file containing student names and their corresponding grades.  
- **Output File**: `sorted_students.txt`  
  - A text file where the student records are sorted by grade in ascending order.  

---

## 🔍 **Program Overview**  
The COBOL program does the following:  
- Opens the input file (`students.txt`) to read the student data.  
- Sorts the records by the student's grade.  
- Saves the sorted records to `sorted_students.txt`.  
- Closes both files after the process is completed.

## 🖥️ **Example Input** (`students.txt`):  
```
John Doe 85  
Jane Smi 92  
Emil Cla 78  
Mich Bro 88
```

---

## 📝 **Example Output** (`sorted_students.txt`):  
```
Emily Cla 78  
John Doe 85  
Mich Bro 88  
Jane Smi 92
```

---

## 💡 **How to Run**  
1. Ensure you have a COBOL compiler (e.g., OpenCOBOL) installed.  
2. Compile the COBOL program using the `cobc` command.  
3. Run the compiled program, ensuring that `students.txt` is available for input.

---

## 🚀 **Next Steps**  
- Improve error handling for file issues (e.g., file not found).  
- Extend functionality to sort in descending order or by multiple fields.
