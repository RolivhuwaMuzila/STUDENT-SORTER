# üìö STUDENT-SORTER üìä

## üë®‚Äçüíª Author: Rolivhuwa Muzila  
## üìÖ Date: 06 March 2025  
## üìù Purpose: Sorts student records by grade in ascending order.  
## üßë‚Äçüíª Technology: COBOL (`cobc`)

---

## **Project Overview**  
The `STUDENT-SORTER` program reads student records (name and grade) from a file, sorts the records by grade in ascending order, and writes the sorted records to a new file. This program uses the COBOL language for file handling and sorting functionality.

---

## **File Details**  
The following files are used in the project:
1. üìÑ `students.txt` ‚Äì The input file containing the student records.
2. üìú `sorted_students.txt` ‚Äì The output file that will contain the sorted student records.
3. üóÇÔ∏è `sort_work.txt` ‚Äì The temporary file used during the sorting process.

## **How to Run**  
1. Ensure that the `students.txt` file is available with the student records.
2. Compile the COBOL program using `cobc`.
3. Execute the program, which will generate the `sorted_students.txt` file with records sorted by grade.

---

## **Notes**  
üîß Ensure that all files are in the same directory when running the program.  
üîç This project is developed and tested using **OpenCOBOL IDE**.
